        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party?",
        "answer": "The professor thinks for a long moment, putting a hand to his chin as he digs up the memories.\n\n“Yes, well, let’s see… After all the unpleasantness, I left for the library. I hoped everyone could just settle down. Well, I didn’t have any hope for my idiot brother and his wife,” he says this without much malice, mostly brotherly chagrin, “but Dr. Mallard I hoped could calm down. He’s quick to anger, but he can be settled down. I saw the butler follow him so I hoped he’d sort him out a little. I tried to calm myself with some reading, but I felt the need to check up on the doctor after a little while. Well, I tried, but his study was shut up and someone was yelling at someone else. My best guess would be Dr. Mallard and his daughter, so I really didn’t want to get in the way. I just went back to my books. After some time, me and my brother and his wife all headed home. It didn’t seem like anything was going to be resolved that night,” he sighs heavily and adjusts his glasses. “The… The murder must’ve happened after we left, none of us really heard anything. Although- I heard that the killer used a silencer, so I guess we wouldn’t have. Still, I should think it would cause a little commotion! So no, I don’t think we were still there when it happened.”\n\nThe professor winces and shakes his head a little, the corners of his mouth drawing downwards. “Awful business. Awful.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun?",
        "answer": "Professor Cuckoo squints at the gun with a little distaste. “I’ll be honest, I don’t know a thing about firearms. I couldn’t really tell you much, but…” he trails off as he looks a little closer. “Maybe- no- well, hm. That does look like the one Dr. Mallard kept in the, the uh, Billiard Room I believe? I remember he showed it to me once, although he knows- knew- how I felt about guns and all that machismo. Apparently he used to hunt when he was younger, kept it around for memories sake. God, I should have,” the professor’s face crumples, “I should’ve just told him to get rid of the damn thing…” \n\nHe goes silent."

        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased?",
        "answer": "The professor smiles sadly, looking down. “We were good friends, him and I. So you can understand why I’m so shaken up, I just… I didn’t expect…”\n\nHe begins pacing a little again, looking up sharply at the detective. “Now I’m sure the others have told you some unflattering things about the good doctor, but at his heart he was a good man. Really. There were just a lot of things,” he sighs and shakes his head. “You see it a lot in men of science, we’re not so good at the emotional side of things. Me and him bonded over that- er, science. He probably felt that I understood him, he could trust me. I felt like we were really getting somewhere.”\n\nProfessor Cuckoo suppresses a small, sudden sob and looks away from the detective. “I’m sorry, anything else?”"

        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor?",
        "answer": "Professor Cuckoo stiffens up at the question a little, but tries to relax. Still, a slight offended expression makes it’s way across his face.\n\n“Why, I was invited the same as anyone else. Me, my brother, his wife, we were all invited. It was a dinner party, we’re friends, what else? I mean, I’m here often anyways. Fairly normal for a friend to be at his friend’s dinner party,” he answers curtly."

    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms?",
        "answer": "He laughs a little at the question, sticking his hands in his pockets. “Of course we were on good terms, we were friends. Unlike some others you might talk to today, I’m not the kind to hang around people I dislike,” he huffed out the last part with a slight roll of his eyes. Feeling the detective’s judgemental eyes, though, he cleared his throat and went for a more mature pose. “What I mean to say is, me and the doctor got along quite well, we had quite a lot of interests in common. I never saw him as some crotchety old man like everyone else around here, I mean for God’s sake the man is… was only in his 50’s. He had a lot to him.”\n\nProfessor Cuckoo sighs at this, biting his cheek. He doesn’t appear to have anything else to say."
