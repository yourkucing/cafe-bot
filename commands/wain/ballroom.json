        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "“Can I? Why, I most certainly could. But will I?” Lady Cuckoo teases, waving a hand with a ladylike giggle. “Well, I don’t have much of a tale to tell. But I’ll try and entertain you regardless.” Lady Cuckoo finds a plush chair positioned by the edge of the ballroom and lowers herself into it, crossing her legs as she begins to speak. “I arrived with my husband, Lord Cuckoo, if you haven’t already met him. It was just like him to be all fussy when we got here! Something about not having gotten the proper invitation or whatnot, but he enjoys making a big deal of things,” she complained, rolling her eyes. “Where was I? Oh, yes, Dr. Mallard! He took us to the dining room, and things were going swimmingly again until that Professor Peregrine nosed his way into things again. Does anyone even like him? Either way, Dr. Mallard let him stay anyways, and then dinner finally got started.”\n\n“And that… that was the best part. You wish you could’ve been there to see it!” Lady Cuckoo croned. “Dr. Mallard certainly has trouble keeping eye contact when you’ve got four eyes, if you know what I mean.” The woman winked, smiling behind a gloved hand, before continuing on. “I don’t mind it. Keeps things interesting. But soon enough Dr. Mallard just HAD to go on about his daughter and her girlfriend again, and the whole thing was ruined. Miss Mallard got so upset she ran off somewhere else, and Dr. Mallard ran the other way. Miss Mallard’s girlfriend and my niece went to check on Miss Mallard, and of course my husband had to go say something to Dr. Mallard despite telling me not to talk to him, the hypocrite!” There’s a dramatic sigh and another wave of her hand. “I didn’t mind him, though. I simply entertained myself in the billiard room for a bit before dancing the night away here in this ballroom. Then Lord Cuckoo came back and we were on our merry way home.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun",
        "answer": "The question initially seems to puzzle Lady Cuckoo, and she lifts a hand to stroke her chin for a moment. Then, she shakes her head. “I can’t say for certain, but there’s an awful lot of folk who could own a gun. Professor Peregrine’s got so much memorbilia that I wouldn’t be surprised if he owned a gun. Maybe Mr. Jay - do gardeners use guns? I’ve never gardened a day in my life - oh, Colonel Kestral’s a good choice! She was in the military, you know. Ms. Gannet’s even a good option. Who knows what she’s hiding under that chef’s hat?” Lady Cuckoo giggles to herself, as this were a fun game, and shrugs. “But who’s to say?”"

        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased",
        "answer": "“Ah, that. Well…” Lady Cuckoo considers her words briefly. How was she to put this? “He’s somewhere between an acquaintance or friend, I’d wager. But really, the whole thing was complicated. You know doctors,” she explains with a shrug. “We’ve spent a fair share of time together. Between my house and his, sometimes it felt like I lived here or he at my place. In a brilliant way, of course. I’ve enjoyed his company.” The woman tilts her head, looking up at the ceiling as if the answer were concealed in the paneling. “I’d like to say he’s enjoyed mine, too.”"

        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "A smile quickly spreads on Lady Cuckoo’s lips. “Dr. Mallard invited me and Professor Cuckoo to his dinner party. I was, expectedly, on the guest list. After all,” Lady Cuckoo lilts, “who wouldn’t want little ol’ me? It certainly isn’t a party without me!” The woman spins out with a dramatic flourish of her dress, showing off the subtle sparkles and curves lined in the fabric. She gives the detective a daring smirk, as though challenging her proclamation, and sidles up close to him. “Perhaps I’d like to invite you to the next social gathering, hm?”"

    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "“Good terms?” Lady Cuckoo repeats, looking a bit surprised at the question. She barely wrinkles the aged creases in her face as she ponders briefly. “Truthfully? I think we were. We’ve got… something settled between us. A bit of a game, if you will,” Lady Cuckoo says, her eyes beginning to light up. “You see… things get a bit boring around here. And what better way to spice it up than a friendly competition? So Dr. Mallard has been eyeing me a bit more than the normal acquaintance would. Sharing a smile too many with me. All in the presence of my, ah, endearing husband.” She lifts her head to meet the detective’s eyes and bashfully lowers her eyelashes just enough to gaze up at him. “Wouldn’t you do that if you had the chance, too?”"
