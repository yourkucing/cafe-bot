        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party?",
        "answer": "Miss Mallard stared at the ground, frowning a little bit as she recalled the incident from the night before. “I… I have been in my room since then. Here…” She gestured at her surroundings before shaking her head and looking back up at the detective with teary eyes. “W-we had gotten into this… huge argument during dinner. He was saying some… mean thing and I—” She choked back a sob. “I said mean things back… I ran off in the middle of dinner and into here… I… haven’t been out ever since.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun?",
        "answer": "The woman’s eyes widened as she looked in shock at the detective. “You mean… Is this the r-rifle that was…?” The question was left hanging as the woman walked backwards and stumbled as she hit her table, her fingers gripping onto it, as if it was the only thing holding her up at that moment. Her voice was soft as she replied. “That is… was one of his old hunting rifles… My… father’s… He used it often because it has a… silencer attached to it…”\n\n“Anyone could have taken them… You know? It’s probably one of those that were displayed in… in our Billard Room… Anyone could have…”"

        "question": "what’s your relation to the deceased?",
        "answer": "“I’m… I’m his daughter…” Her lips trembled as she bit them, trying to stop the tears from falling once more."

    {
        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor?",
        "answer": "“I just… I wanted to repair burned bridges…” She replied softly. “He… kicked me out a few years back but I’ve always… I am happy in my relationship… And a part of me wanted his blessing.” She let out a small tearful smile. “He was my father, you know? At the end of the day, he was my father and I was hoping he would be happy for me in the end…”"

    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms?",
        "answer": "Miss Mallard shook her head. “We have not been on good terms since… since I was kicked out. And we haven’t spoken for six years… But… this dinner party was me… trying. I was hoping that he would be happy to see me happy.” She let out a small sob. “He was my father… He wasn’t easy to love, but he was my father… I just… wanted him to love me for me. I was hoping…”\n\nShe looked towards a picture on her nightstand, a teenage her and her father, and she whispered. “And now he’s dead, and I can’t…” She looked towards the detective again, the tears falling. “I can never fix things with him anymore… and I don’t know how to deal with that…”"
