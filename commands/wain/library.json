        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "Ms. Wren considered. She was still smiling, a tad giddily, thin lips stretched taught. She made no effort at all to sober up or show any smidge of sensibility. “Well, I myself was hard at work practically all evening. As was Grumpy Gannet, Old Penguin, Older Jay, and that pipsqueak driver with all the style — Hawk was it? No, Falcon! Falcon, yes.”\n\n“I’d just finished listening in on the hullabaloo through the walls, and was restoring a particularly crumbly first edition of the Hound of the Baskervilles. That was when Professor Cuckoo popped in. Oh, that poor sod. A real pity of a man, that one… So anyway, he'd popped in, and there was just about an entire colony of ants in his pants. Kept looking about as if something were after him. Or as if he were waiting on a guest. Or maybe there was a guest after him…?” She let that sit for a moment, waggling her eyebrows for unnecessary dramatic emphasis. “Anywho, then he left for a time, before returning *again*. I was about ready to tell him to knock off the dawdling when Lord Cuckoo, his brother of course, and an even soddier sod of a man if you ask me, came asking about him. He was gone by then.”\n\n“The real fun happened after all the guests were gone. Fernando and I got all the juicy bits and what have you down at the Servant’s Quarters. And that must have been around the time—” She put her hands together to mime firing a gun into the detective’s forehead. “Didn't hear a thing. Why, none of us did. And I've got ears like a bat, you know.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun",
        "answer": "Ms. Wren’s gaze flickered. With interest, maybe? It was one thing hearing about her employer’s death, and another being faced with the very weapon that had succeeded in doing away with him. Lips pursed in amusement, she moved her hand to shield Fernando’s vacant, unseeing eyes.\n\n“That would be Dr. Mallard’s very own hunting rifle. From the Billiard Room,” She casually leaned over to read the manufacturer name, engraved near the bottom. “Remington! What a fussy name for such a crude looking object. But you know men and their deer-killing weapons. Dr. Mallard loved his rifles, he did. ‘Find what you love and let it kill you,’ that's Charles Bukowski, that. Very insightful, don't you agree?” She tittered. Using her other hand, she reached out to stroke a finger down the cool metal of the rifle, as if she were petting a kitten. Multiple rings adorned her spidery fingers, and her nails were painted a haunting, garish orange. “Ha! What irony.”"

        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased",
        "answer": "“My relation to Dr. Mallard? We weren't rela— *ohhh*. Yes, yes, I've got you.” Ms. Wren nodded vehemently. “Well, I've been working for Dr. Mallard as the Manor librarian and archivist for well over… has it been about 20 years now, Fernando? Yes, about 20 years.” She gave a short whistle. “Phew, isn't that something! Feels as though it were only yesterday the Dr. Mallard was berating me for my minimal English skills.” She sighed wistfully.\n\n“I suppose I don't work for anyone now. Hm! Do you think I'll still be allowed to continue here now that he's kicked the bucket?” She asked, not giving the detective a chance to answer before ploughing on. “Ah, who am I kidding! Miss Mallard’s a dear. Assuming the manor is bequeathed to her, and it had *better be*, I know she wouldn't dismiss a poor old woman like me, with nowhere else to turn to…”"
    },
    {
        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "“I’m the librarian, silly dearie.” Ms. Wren reached over to bap the detective’s nose playfully. “I believe I already mentioned that. Did I? I think I did.”"
    },
    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "“Were we on good terms?” Ms. Wren ran her fingers through Fernando’s matted feathers, silent for a beat before bursting into a short titter. “That's terribly forward.”\n\n“Well, I'll say that you'd never catch Dr. Mallard and I swept up in any emotionalism like some of the other sorts around here, for starters… He and I had quite a strictly professional relationship.” She nodded curtly to seal her claim. “In all the time I knew him, he was a precise, no-nonsense, methodical man who valued academics and the arts above most, at the very least enough to keep me around. He was intellectual, and cultivated… in most areas. He knew his business and he knew how to conduct it well.” Her tone was cool and collected as she spoke, and her manic edged smile had since turned soft. She paused for a moment before continuing. “I'll always be grateful for the life he’s given me. He found me in a bog, you know. So no, I had no problem with him, professionally. We were on better terms than most around here…”\n\n“That's not to say I didn't have any personal feelings towards him. And I know that you're looking for all of the truth. So I’ll tell you!” Ms. Wren leant in gleefully, elbows against the desk. “Personally? Well, I don't think that Dr. Mallard was much of a person at all. Personally, I think that he was an incorrigible prick, with a petrified cactus in place of a heart. A complete self-serving humbug, and above that, a loathsome excuse for a man and father.” Her smile remained rictus on her face as she spoke. Though now her eyes had a glint that was no longer shrewd, or playful, but unkind and waspish.\n\n“What have I to say about his death? Well overdue. Not that I believe he was even worth going to the trouble of killing. Bit of an extreme measure to take, but not unwarranted.” She finished happily, resting her chin in her hand as though she'd just finished recounting a day at the park. She clearly had no qualms about speaking ill of the dead."
