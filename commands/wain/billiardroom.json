        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "Lord Cuckoo snorted. “My actions? MY actions? Look. Mallard, arrogant dick that he is, decided to invite myself, my wife, and my brother to his stupid dinner party. I didn’t even know he was having his daughter around, or whatever. Mallard just keeps inviting himself over, and then having us over in some sick game – Whatever.\n\n“Anyway he was a fucking pig all night, just making eyes at MY wife, and then when she doesn’t give him the time of day, he blows up at his own daughter and storms off. Good riddance. As for me, I left with my wife and brother not long after his little outburst. He’s a fucked up man, but I didn’t kill him. I wasn’t even here when he died.”"

    {
        "question": "do you know who owns this gun",
        "answer": "Lord Cuckoo stared at the gun, incredulously. “Do I – Of course I don’t! I don’t even care.” He got up and paced the Billiard room, gesturing to all the guns along the walls. “Hell, it could even be his as far as I know. Ever consider that? Mallard went shooting all the time, all the good it did him. Awful shot.”"
    },
    {
        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased",
        "answer": "Lord Cuckoo couldn’t stop a snort. “My relation? Well, even that’s more of a word than I’d use to describe it. Nothing. No relation.” He paced, unable to stay still. “He’s the son of a bitch who kept trying to steal my wife. He’s meaningless to me. Nonexistent.\n\nLord Cuckoo looked up as he said that, eyes wide, as if just remembering that Mallard was dead. He didn’t hide his laugh. “Ha! Even more nonexistent now, huh? Guess karma’s a bitch.”"
    },
    {
        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "“Well, today it’s because you brought me and my family back here.” Lord Cuckoo responded, crabbily. “But for the dinner party? We were invited. Well. Technically the invite only named Lady Cuckoo and Professor Cuckoo, my brother. But there was no chance in hell I was letting her come alone. He only did that because he wanted to make me mad, the bastard. That’s just the kind of guy he is. Was. Whatever. Hope he rots in hell. Anyway, we were invited, and no one did anything. Got it?”"
    },
    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "Lord Cuckoo gave a barking laugh. “I’m not going to stand here and pretend me and Mallard were close. You could ask anyone in here, and they’ll tell you how much I hated the bastard. And maybe in your stupid, cop head of yours, you think that makes me the prime suspect. Well, you’re wrong.”\n\nLord Cuckoo stalked closer. “I’m not your killer. I’m not even a suspect. He was alive when I left. But I’ll tell you something, ‘detective’. I only wish I had killed him myself.”"
