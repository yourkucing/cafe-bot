        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "Miss Crane toyed with the corner of a napkin that was at the place setting where she sat. She knew that answering would force her to relive seeing the look on her cousin’s face right before she ran off. Her lips pressed together tightly before they parted again.\n\n“Andrea is like a sister to me, so when she left the dinner table in tears, I didn’t hesitate to follow after her. I wanted to comfort her in the way that any caring older sister would, but she wouldn’t open her bedroom door for me, or for Colonel Kestral. We could hear her sobbing through the door, but I don’t blame her. She must have been mortified after the scene during dinner. Knowing she was going through that kind of turmoil, and I couldn’t talk to her to try and make it better, upset me.” She looked about the kitchen with sullen eyes. “That’s when I came in here looking for a spot of tea for my own comfort while giving Andrea the space she needed.”\n\nHer eyes fell down to the cup in her hands and she lifted it to her lips again. “I spoke to Ms. Gannet in here for a little while. She’s a lovely, caring woman. I was tired, so I went to my room to sleep shortly afterwards.” She flicked her gaze back over to the Detective almost challengingly. “You can ask her yourself if you want.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun",
        "answer": "Miss Crane looked at the gun, and as the question hung in the air, she drank the rest of her tea and stood up to go refill her empty cup from the kettle. “Yes, I know whose gun that is. I’ve seen it a few times during my stay here as I’m certain every member of this household has.” She finally replied while pouring. \n\nShe turned around from facing the counter and made her way back over to the table with her fresh cup of tea. “It’s one of my Uncle’s hunting rifles.” She answered with a matter-of-fact tone while placing the cup on the table. The woman slid back into her chair again, and with a poised posture, folded her hands neatly over a knee."

        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased",
        "answer": "“As I have mentioned before, Dr. Mallard was my Uncle, but he took on the role of father figure after my parents died when I was young.” Miss Crane tucked a strand of loose hair behind her ear, and then continued.\n\n“The Mallards took me in and raised me like a second daughter. Andrea and I are just as close as any sisters. I just wish my Uncle would have accepted her for who she is, and perhaps that could have happened over time, but…” She trailed off and looked down to fidget with her fingers in her lap. “Now we’ll never know.”"

        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "Miss Crane seemed almost offended by this question. As if a family member needed to have a reason to visit their loved ones. “This is my home.” She stated simply, gesturing her hand around the general area, but indicating the entirety of the manor.\n\n“I came back to live here when my Uncle fell ill about three years ago. I’ve been helping to look after things and run the household and the staff while he was unwell.” She added a few more cubes of sugar to her cup and stirred slowly. “I had been looking forward to getting everyone back together again. Then… all this happened.” Miss Crane heaves a heavy sigh, seeming to be weary of having to be questioned like this."

        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "Miss Crane stood up again and folded her arms around herself in a protective manner. She walked over to a house plant hanging in front of a window, and spent a couple of moments admiring the leaves.\n\n“My Uncle was not an easy man to get along with.” She feathered her fingers delicately over the soft green leaves. “After my parents died, he was one of the people who helped raise me. He treated me like a daughter despite the fact that I wasn’t. He even had a strong hand in me becoming a lawyer even though it was hard to leave this place to go to college. I definitely owe the life I am able to have now to my Uncle.”\n\nShe pauses before turning around to the detective again. Her face was serious. “That doesn’t mean that I approved of the way he treated my dear cousin. Somewhere deep inside he had to know it was wrong.” Miss Crane returned to the table once more, though she was feeling restless."
