        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "“Oh, like – My actions? Are you… Do you think I had something to do with this?” Mr. Falcon fidgeted. “Look, man, I don’t know what anyone’s told you, but I didn’t see or hear nothin’. I was on duty, and stationed right here.” He gestured. “The Garage. Nothing fun ever happens in here. Like, I guess I saw when the Cuckoos arrived, right? Lord and Lady Cuckoo were arguing like always. And I saw Professor Peregrine arrive. Went to the backyard first, before coming around and knocking.\n\nMr. Falcon screwed his face up, trying to think. “Well, and then I think Professor Peregrine was the first to leave. Not immediately, not when he was first kicked out, mind you. But still, first to go. The Cuckoos left sometime after, in a bit of a hurry. But that’s all I know. Once the guests were gone, my shift was done, so I left. Never heard about the death thing until – Now, I guess.”"

    {
        "question": "do you know who owns this gun",
        "answer": "Mr. Falcon stared at it, eyes wide. “Whoa, bro, like that’s the gun they used to kill him? Wicked! Can I touch – ” He seemed to remember himself. “I mean, uh, no I don’t think I know it. Looks like a hunting rifle, though. My dad has lots like that.” He looked immensely pleased with himself. “Hear that? Hunting rifle. Like I’m a detective now and whatever.”"

    {
        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased",
        "answer": "“Whoa. That’s a real detective-y question.” Mr. Falcon thought about it. “I don’t know if we really had much of a relationship? I guess he was like, a friend of my dad. Family friend, maybe? That’s how I got this job. But I didn’t really KNOW know him, if you know what I mean.”"
    },
    {
        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "“Well.” Mr. Falcon gestured around the garage. “Had work to do, didn’t I? I’m basically working all the time. It’s really boring, but my dad says its good for me, or whatever. Just for this summer, though. I’m going off to college and then I’ll never have to do this shit ever again.”"
    },
    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "Mr. Falcon looked like a deer in the headlights at that question. “Wow, bro, I guess that’s a big question, right? Like, I mean, I don’t know. I guess so? I didn’t really know him well.”\n\nMr. Falcon leaned against a car. “My dad said he’s a good doctor. Or, like, was. He said I could learn a lot from him about his work ethic, and business practices, and whatever. But I haven’t really seen much of either of those since I worked here. I basically just drive him around, and that’s that. I don’t even want to work here, but my dad thinks I’ve been ‘spoiled’ or whatever,” he did the finger quotes for extra zest, “and isn’t giving me any spending money until the summer is over. Its fucking dumb.”\n\nHe realized that he hadn’t fully addressed the question, and veered back to it. “Anyway, I guess like – Yeah, we were on good terms, but we weren’t friends or anything. I guess I appreciate he gave me a job, though.”"
