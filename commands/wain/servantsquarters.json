        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party?",
        "answer": "Ms. Gannet’s clear blue eyes dart to the left as she attempts to recall the events of the evening. “Dr. Mallard was screaming so loud I could hear him from the kitchen, even so Miss Crane come in to see me and tell me what happened. While she was speaking - that Professor Peregrine was trying to push in through the door. He’s always around corners and outside windows trying to hear what’s going on but I wouldn’t have it,”  she paused to sigh with a bit of frustration, “When I get back from getting rid of ‘im, Miss Crane had to go. So I cleaned everything up and retired to my room for the night.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun?",
        "answer": "She flinched as the gun was revealed, “That’s it then?” Her brows furrowed in concentration, “I believe I’ve seen one like it before but I couldn’t tell you who it belonged to. I don’t know much about guns mind you.” Her gaze remained on the weapon even so, she seemed interested in the barrel."

        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased?",
        "answer": "“I came to work for Dr. Mallard when I turned twenty and three, it’s been about 10 years now.” Her eyes lingered over her suitcase as she answered, despite an attempt to remain detached and business-like there was an air of apprehension. “I’m his cook, nothing more.”"

        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor?",
        "answer": "She blinked at the question, “I work here, detective, where else should I be?”"

    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms?",
        "answer": "Ms. Gannet pursed her lips. “I was a good cook, I never stepped out of place or spoke up when I shouldn’t… or perhaps when I should’ve. But… I didn’t like Dr. Mallard much… no matter what you may feel about Miss Mallard and the Kestral girl, you don’t turn your back on family,” her face started to turn pink with anger, “The man’s got a cruel streak in him a hundred miles long. He delighted in seeing people suffer. I’ve been meaning to leave for years… Lord forgive me for saying so but I’m glad he’s dead. Good riddance!” Ms. Gannet sheepishly falls silent."
