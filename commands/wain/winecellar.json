        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "Peregrine stared at the detective and started talking excitedly, “I definitely knew something was going to happen. Dr.Mallard gave an ultimatum to Miss Mallard, after her scandalous relationship came to light. And then Miss Mallard ran inside crying. Her girlfriend and her cousin followed her inside. Then Dr. Mallard went to his room. On the other side of the hall, Lord and Lady Cuckoo appeared to be arguing with each other. I tried to get close to listen in on their conversation, when the butler rudely asked me to leave. Stil, I managed to get past the butler into the house and sneak into the kitchen. There I found the cook and Miss Crane in a conversation. Before I could say anything, the cook rudely asked me to leave. It was so unfair, you see? As one of the guests, I had every right to stay on. But only I was forced to leave, while the other guests stayed on for much longer! I know that because I saw their car in the garage. The employees here are very rude.”"

        "question": "do you know who owns this gun",
        "answer": "“This gun?” Peregrine gestured. “I believe I have seen something of this kind before, though I do not recall where. You see, all these rich manor lords have their own stock of weapons. Perhaps this gun belongs to Lord Cuckoo? Or it could even belong to Dr. Mallard. Yes, that makes more sense. He probably shot himself, quite ashamed of this scandalous affair.”"

        "question": "what's your relation to the deceased",
        "answer": "“Me?” Peregrine straightened, offended. “I am his neighbour since 20 years! We may not be very close. But I do try to talk to him now and then.”"

    {
        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "Peregrine paced, hesitant. “Er… Well. I just happened to pass by when Dr. Mallard waved out to me. He was generous enough to invite me to join the party last night.”"
    },
    {
        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "Peregrine bounced on his heels. “Indeed! We were not close friends, you see? But being long-time neighbours, we definitely smiled and nodded to each other every day.”"
