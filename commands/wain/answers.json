It was the biggest honor to be had among my circle of WoP friends (especially Lissy, Angela & I). I was so honored that Veo would contact me, invite me to topics and care to RP with me at all, because of the Quality of their RP work, their amazing creativity and humor and that feeling has never gone away. I love you, Wain (Dodges vomiting) and I am so glad to be counted among your friends. I am so glad that you were born and I hope you have a truly good birthday!\n - AndromeTessaGregErrolCountessEtc"
