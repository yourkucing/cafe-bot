        "question": "can you recount your actions after the dinner party",
        "answer": "Kestrel was battling internally with a desire to impose her formidable will on this person or to answer the question. Ultimately, she chose the action that would likely allow her to be released sooner. “I don’t know if the “party” ended when I followed Andrea after dinner or not,” she scowled on the word ‘party’.  “But after that man decided to announce to everyone present that his child was ‘a stain on the family name’, I spent the rest of my evening outside of Andrea’s bedroom. She was distraught and nothing I said would convince her to let me in.” Sighing, the Colonel looks down at her hands. “I don’t know how long I was outside her door; only that at some point Miss Crane helped me to this room, where I fell asleep again.”Moving forward, Kestrel inspects the weapon, handling it without hesitation or fear. As she checks the chamber of the gun - empty, as she knew it would be, because who would allow a questioning subject to handle a loaded firearm - she returns it with a shrug. “It’s an old hunting rifle. Most families have something of this sort on their estates. I would assume that it belongs to Dr. Mallard; but that could be incorrect.”"

        "question": "can you explain why you were at the manor",
        "answer": "In one fluid, powerful movement, Kestrel rises from her seat and paces to the window, looking out at the grounds below. “Andrea has told me for years abou her… complicated… relationship with her father. Even when she said she didn’t care, I could see that it affected her deeply. I wanted to… fix things, for her.” The Colonel’s hand goes to a pocket, fingering something inside it. “She told me she didn’t want to come; told me he was an unfeeling bastard. I thought I could change his mind; get him to see how amazing she is and finally acknowledge it to her. But he hurt her again, worse than before. And it was MY fault. But I promised her last night that I wouldn’t ever let him get to her. Never again. And I meant it.”"

        "question": "were you and dr. mallard on good terms",
        "answer": "She scoffs, and her eyes flare with an emotion dark and dangerous. “We were not; but that was HIS fault and no one else’s. I tried to bridge the gap, smooth things over. I didn’t want him to regret not being there for the happiest moments of our— of his daughter’s life. What father wouldn’t want to see his child happy and in love? What father wouldn’t want to make things right instead of remaining estranged from his own child?” Kestrel’s hands have balled into fists. “Dr. Mallard; that’s who. He is a despicable man, and I hate him for everything he did to Andrea, both back then, and now.”"
