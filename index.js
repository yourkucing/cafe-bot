All of that fear just welled up in him and he shut down. I think he was afraid that it was his fault that she was a ‘deviant’, like he hadn’t raised her like a good straight man would.

A smile stretched across her lips and her eyebrows twitched with some modicum of approval. “Dan Brown…The Lost Symbol… hmm fitting.

I'm sure you’ve already heard of Dr. Mallard’s… dalliance.” She started casually, gauging the detective's expression as she wet her index finger and flipped a page.\n\n“But did you know that beast Lord Cuckoo had got his knickers twisted for all the wrong reasons? It wasn't his wife who'd been pussyfooting around with the Dr. behind his back, but his very own brother!” She burst into a short and slightly forced bout of laughter. “Everyone presumed it was the Lady. I mean, she's just got that atmosphere about her, doesn't she? No disrespect, I'm sure she's a fine woman, aside from her taste in men, very well endowed. And Dr. Mallard would wreck a thousand homes before he felt a tinge of remorse.”\n\n“Well, I even thought so myself about the Lady, until I caught the pair, Dr. Mallard and Professor Cuckoo, defiling that very aisle over there,” she pointed, “contesting to see who could reach the other’s throat with their tongue first.” Her knuckles tinged with white around the book as she let that sit for a beat. “Isn't that the funniest thing?” She didn't sound like she found it very funny. “All that outcry from Dr. Mallard about his daughter and her love, and yet…” She trailed off with a sigh. “Anyhow. What a ghastly little pairing. All the more horrible for its sheer sanctimony.”`)

Thinks the whole entire world is after him. Why, the man’s wrought like a neurotic chihuahua, and sturdy as a plastic fork. Who's to say Dr. Mallard wasn't the tough steak to his plastic fork? Who's to say he didn’t… snap, perhaps, take matters with Dr. Mallard into his own hands? Now there's something to think about.”\n\nThere was a long and significant stretch of silence, save for the sound of pages being turned. Fernando was apparently a very fast reader.\n\n“Well, I hate to cut this short, but I’m afraid that's all I can offer you today, dearie. If you want the whole good truth, I recommend you consult Miss Crane.” She flipped another page. “Or even that poor sap Professor Cuckoo, if you'd like to know more about the affair. God knows, I'd want to know what was going through his sap mind during *that* entire ordeal.” She gave a shudder, and Fernando jumped in her lap.\n\n“See ya,” she singsonged without lifting her gaze from the book, wiggling her fingers, “wouldn't wanna be ya.”`)

The ‘Good Dr’ even threatened to remove her as his heir. Though I don’t recall the lawyer ever coming here.  She worked for everything, paid for all she needed herself. Miss Mallard has not expected anything from her father, what other reason would she have to even come back here but to reconcile?\n\nAs I’m thinking, I do recall that as I left the study and as returning to the Dining Hall . or kitchen, I can’t remember which, I passed Lord Cuckoo going in the other direction. TOWARDS the study. Normally I would have assisted him in finding the facilities, but I was - upset. The Dr attempting . . to make ME throw his daughter out for the second time!

He’s always sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong so he can involve himself in whatever’s going on. He doesn’t invite himself over often, but it was just really odd how he inserted himself into that dinner last night too, out of any night he could have done so.

It’s been a difficult morning.” She took a sip and then moved to set the cup down on the table, though it rattled against the saucer as it was placed. She made her way over to the detective with an outstretched hand.\n\n“I’m Miss Crane.

Altogether, her outfit was an offence against taste and decency.

She insisted.”\n\n“She was the only reason why I had even showed up to the dinner. She was… determined for us to fix our relationship… I mean, after everything, I just wanted my father to reach out. To apologise.” Her fingers slowly traced over a picture of her father. “I thought he might regret… losing me. And… that look that he gave me when I first came out to him. It was so full of disgust, like I was some… shit at the bottom of his shoes… I did not ever want to see it again.”\n\n“But… he was my father. I gave up on him, but I never wanted him to… to be gone…” She continued staring at the photo album, before shaking her head. “I’m sorry but… I would like to be alone now.

Looking back up at the detective, she suddenly glared at him. “What are you still doing here? Please leave. Leave me alone! Talk to Jennifer if you must but leave me alone!

I knew I hated him then, wanted to confront him immediately… but Andrea needed me. So I followed her just in time to see her slam the door of her bedroom on the second floor. I pleaded with her to let me in. Miss Crane was there as well and tried to assist. But she left and it was just me for who knows how long; listening to the woman I loved crying herself to sleep. Even when I knew she wasn’t awake anymore, I stayed. At least until Miss Crane came back and implored me to take to bed in one of the guest rooms.”\n\nRecounting the events of the evening brought the now familiar scowl to Kestrel’s face. “I understand more and more why Andrea was against coming here. It wasn’t just her father, you know. Lady Cuckoo was just as bad. I saw her. During the entire dinner, even with her husband yelling at Dr. Mallard, and then what happened between Dr. Mallard and Andrea, she just sat there the whole time wearing a shit-eating grin, loving the drama of it all. It was obvious to me and probably everyone else there that she’s heartless.”\n\nAfter one more appraising look at the investigator, Kestrel sat back down, this time in a recliner by the window. “If you need to confirm anything I am telling you, I would suggest that you speak with either Miss Crane or Ms. Gannet next. They were there and witnessed everything happen as well. If you’ve already spoke. With them… well, maybe you ARE capable of solving this mystery.”`)

But she did not turn back around. “I am done with this conversation. If you wish to get more information, obtain it elsewhere.
